1. Use express install for "workspace folder" to install ver version.
File hierarchy:

L:\Espressif
└──idf_v5.5.1  (make this folder for each version)
    ├── idf              (make this folder, choose as idf location)
    └── tools            (make this folder, choose as toolchain folder)

2.
a. Use a project sample to generate the required .vscode folder files.
b. ESP_IDF: Add VSCode Configuration folder (will add settings.json & launch.json)

--- settings.josn ---
Use options at bottom to select:
    - flashing method
    - com port
    - openocd target board (IDF_TARGET)

--- c_cpp_properties.json ---

Set this to the current toolchain version compiler (this will prevent include sq):
"compilerPath": "${config:idf.toolsPathWin}\\tools\\xtensa-esp-elf\\esp-14.2.0_20241119\\xtensa-esp-elf\\bin\\xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gcc.exe",

Add compiler commands:
"compileCommands": ["${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json"],


# Debugging
Download Zadig tool (Zadig_X.X.exe) from https://zadig.akeo.ie/ and run it.
Set (Interface 1) to libusbk. Don't touch (Interface 0 is serial port).
If I need to reset the driver for the serial port. Go to Device Manager. THen USB devices and update driver.

Set Adapter Speed in esp jtag config file in toolchain folder:
adapter speed 20000

In Zadig tool go to Options and check List All Devices.

Check the list of devices that should contain two specific USB entries:  (Interface 0) and  (Interface 1).

The first device ( (Interface 0)) is connected to the JTAG port of the ESP32. Original driver of this device should be replaced with WinUSB (v6xxxxx).

Note: Do not change the second device (Interface 1). It is routed to ESP32's serial port (UART) used for upload of application to ESP32's flash.

There are two versions of this board: 4MB Flash/2MB PSRAM or 8MB Flash/No PSRAM
I have (2) of the 4MB Flash/2MB PSRAM for the smaller QTPy's.

Make sure
"idf.openOcdDebugLevel": 1,
If it is set too high (like 4) things will take too long and it will error out.
