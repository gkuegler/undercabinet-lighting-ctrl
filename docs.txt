Display Driver for ST7789 on ESP32

Requirements:
- compiled with c
- compatible with lvgl framework
- asyncronous transfers with dma
- thread safe (relies on esp32 spi driver)
- kconfig? or defines? or struct?
- st7789 must be on its own spi bus

Screen Cabalilities:
- adjustable screen size
- adjustabe screen rotation

SPI cababilities:
- variable dma buffer size; warn on max?
- variable clock
- variable gpio pins
- imux yes/no/auto


plan:
- [x] basic flush impplementation that can redraw the whole screen, single buf
- [x] flush impplementation that can redraw sub areas (RENDER_MODE_PARTIAL)
- [x] double buf support
- [x] screen orientation in hardware
    - [x] move row start and stop to function from 'st7789_init_cmds'
    - [ ] make a screen hardware dimensions parameter. have the user set screen hardware dimensions for natural orientation then picking an orientation internally generates the rowcol start/stop params.
- [x] factor out lvgl from st7789 code
- [ ] factor out defined parameters from st7789 code
- [ ] support software reset
- [ ] support other hardware 'c' series and common dev boards
- [ ] complete todo's

lvgl example:
- [ ] how to get gui to update with limited stack tasks?
- [ ] draw rectangle
- [ ] layout labels in grid and flex options
- [ ] rotary encoder to update std out
- [ ] rotary encoder to update label
